# REVERSE ARRAY

The **concat()** method reverses an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, the first array element 
now becoming the last, and the last array element becoming the first. In other words, elements order in the array will 
be turned towards the direction opposite to that previously stated.

```JS
const array1 = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
const reversed = array1.reverse();
// expected output: Array ["three", "two", "one"]
```

For this exercise we want you to build a reverseArray() function that solves the same task with **for loops ONLY**.

A reverseArray() function should
* Take an initial arrays as an argument
* Return a reversed array
