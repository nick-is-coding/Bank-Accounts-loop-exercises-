// doesArrayInclude(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'a') => true
// doesArrayInclude(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'f') => false
// NOTE: You can NOT use the array.includes() method in your code

export function doesArrayInclude(array, value) {
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){

}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-17"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
